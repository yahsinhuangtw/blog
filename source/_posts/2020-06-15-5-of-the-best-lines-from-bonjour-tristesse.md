I read [Françoise Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Sagan)'s "[Bonjour Tristess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_Tristesse)," on Sunday morning. The title means "Hello, Sadness" in English. It was published in 1954. It's a slim book; it's a distrubing book. I was planning to wrap up my entire complicated set up of my little Raspberry Pi Zero with a Camera Module v2 on Sunday night, to get the project going and make progress and stuff, but I didn't get to it. Because I was so distracted by this little book! 

I can't stop thinking about it after reading it. What the heck did I just read? What's going on with this 17-year-old girl Cécile? What's up with Cécile and Anne? There's definitely something going on with Cécile and Anne, and with Cécile and Elsa. A few hours after reading it, I realized the story was more about these three women - Cécile, Anne, Elsa fighting for Raymond's attention and affection; that it was less about Cyril and Raymond, or Cécile and Cyril.

Here are 5 of the best lines from perhaps what is Françoise Sagan's best-loved work, Bonjour Tristesse.
