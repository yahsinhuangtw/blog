I read [Françoise Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Sagan)'s "[Bonjour Tristess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_Tristesse)," on Sunday morning. The title means "Hello, Sadness" in English. It was published in 1954. It's a slim book; it's a distrubing book. I was planning to wrap up my entire complicated set up of my little Raspberry Pi Zero with a Camera Module v2 on Sunday night, to get the project going and make progress and everything, but I didn't get to it. Because I was so distracted by this little book! 

I can't stop thinking about it after reading it. What the heck did I just read? What's going on with this seventeen-year-old girl Cécile? What's up with Cécile and Anne? There's definitely something going on with Cécile and Anne, and with Cécile and Elsa. A few hours after reading it, I realized the story was more about these three women - Cécile, Anne, Elsa fighting for Raymond's attention and affection; that it was less about Cyril and Raymond, or Cécile and Cyril.

### What's the story about?

The story is about a seventeen-year-old Cécile, her carefree father Raymond, and Raymond's mistress Elsa haveing a summer vacation in a villa outside of Paris. Cécile met a handsome law student Cyril and was going to have a little summer romance with him. But the arrival of Anne, her late mother's best friend, makes everything fall apart. Raymond quickly transferred his attention to Anne, they fell in love. Elsa was treated very badly and got abandoned by Raymond. Raymond and Anne decided that they want to get married. This is bad news for Cécile because this means that she can no long enjoy the pleasures of life. Anne is a very cultured, sophisticated, intelligent, calm, self-contained, sometimes indifferent, almost tiger mom-like person, whom Cécile is oftentimes afraid of. Since Anny and Raymond planned to get married soon, Anne started to play this godmother role in Cécile's life; she got her boxed in and started to make her study for exams.

### 5 of the best lines from Bonjour Tristesse

Here are 5 of the best lines from perhaps what is Françoise Sagan's best-loved work, Bonjour Tristesse.

"Late into the night we talked of love, of its complications. In my father's eyes they were imaginary. [...] This conception of rapid, violent and passing love affairs appealed to my imagination. I was not at the age when fidelity is attractive. I knew very little about love." (P7)

"He would have liked to know that I was tormented by our situation, but I was not; in fact my only torment at that moment was the way my heart was thumping. He bent over me. [...] He kissed me gently. I looked at the sky, then saw nothing but lights bursting under my closed eyelids. The warmth, dizziness, and the taste of our first kisses continued for long moments." (P9)

"The next morning I was awakened by a slanting ray of hot sunshine that flooded my bed and put an end to my strange and rather confused dreams. [...] I went down to the terrace in my pyjamas and found Anne glancing through the newspapers. I noticed that she was lightly, but perfectly, made up; apparently she never allowed herself a real holiday. As she paid no attention to me, I sat down on the steps with a cup of coffee and an orange to enjoy the delicious morning. I bit the orange and let its sweet juice run into my mouth, then took a gulp of scalding black coffee and went back to the orange again." (P15)

"I fetched a cigarette from the table and struck a match. It went out. With shaking hands I lighted another, and although there was no wind, it went out. In exasperation I took a third, and for some reason this match assumed a vital importance; perhaps because Anne was watching me intently. Sunddenly everything around me seemed to melt away and there was nothing left but the match between my fingers, the box, and Anne's eyes boring into me. My heart was beating violently. I tightened my fingers round the match and struck it, but as I bent forward my cigarette put it out. The matchbox dropped to the ground and I could feel Anne's hard, searching gaze upon me. The tension was unbearable." (P64)

"Apart from these incidents and filling our daily life were Anne's confidence, gentleness and (I hate to use the word) happiness. She was nearer to happiness than I had ever seen her since she had been at our mervy, egoists that we were." (P87)
