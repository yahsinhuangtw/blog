Joan Didion’s 2011 Memoir, Blue Nights

I recently finished reading Joan Didion’s “Blue Nights,” a book about the death of her daughter Quintana Roo. For the past month, every night I would read a few pages before I fall asleep. Towards the end of the book, it was devastating; a few passages made me cry. 

For some reason I might be the type of person who is quick to tears — I may be a highly sensitive person; I wept several times while reading Joan Didion’s intensely personal memoir, “The Year of Magical Thinking,” published in 2005. In the book she recounted with piercing detail how she came to terms with her husband John Gregory Dunne’s sudden death at the dinner table. In our age of distraction, I wonder if anyone will remember when was the last time a writer made you cry.

It is a little hard for me to believe that Joan Didion has died at age 87 from Parkinson’s disease in 2021 because her books are still very much alive in my life. Below are some texts I noted while reading the book.
